Author: David Rodrigues https://www.linkedin.com/in/davidrodrigues/ November, 2020

The objective of this project is to explore relationships between SAT scores and demographic factors in New York City public schools. SAT, or Scholastic Aptitude Test, is a test that high school seniors in the U.S. take every year. The SAT has three sections, each of which is worth a maximum of 800 points. Colleges use the SAT to determine which students to admit. High average SAT scores are usually indicative of a good school.

New York City has published data on student SAT scores by high school, along with additional demographic data sets. We will work with 8 different datasets:

sat_results.csv - Data on SAT scores
demographics.csv - Data on demographics
class_size.csv - Data on class size
graduation.csv - Data on graduation outcomes
ap_2010.csv - Data on AP test results
hs_directory.csv - A directory of high schools
survey_all.txt - Data on surveys from all schools
survey_d75.txt - Data on surveys from New York City district 75
